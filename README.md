#📚 MySQL Practice Repository

Welcome to my MySQL practice repository! This project contains all the SQL scripts and notes I’ve written while learning and experimenting with MySQL queries, database design, and relational operations.

---

#✅ Topics Covered

- ✔️ Creating databases and tables
- ✔️ Inserting and modifying data
- ✔️ Filtering using `WHERE` and `HAVING`
- ✔️ Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.)
- ✔️ All types of joins:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN`
  - Simulated `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- ✔️ Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`)
- ✔️ Subqueries and nested SELECTs
- ✔️ Safe update mode usage (`SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0`)
